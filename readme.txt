About The Retribal Music Festival WordPress Plugin

The Free Retribal Music Festival WordPress plugin works with any theme and is full of features to engage your 
fans, sponsors, artists, staff, volunteers, venues and stages.

Deep Artist and Venue Profiles

Music Festivals are about discovery. Shouldn’t your website do it’s part? Performer and Venue information 
management is a breeze when you use Retribal on your music festival website. Tie in artist feeds automatically, 
official performer and venue social media are embedded on your website as they are released before, during and 
after your event. Supports youtube, facebook, twitter, instagram, vine, and more. Sharing is built in with 
social media-ready landing pages for each performer and venue directly on your music festival website.

Retribal’s smooth layouts and seamless integration with your fully branded, custom WordPress website allows 
your attendees to discover more, and in real time — from your stage to their screen.

Rock-solid Festival Technology

WordPress out of the box is already a great platform for your music festival, but that doesn't mean we can't 
improve it further! Our plugins and apps were borne of the need for a dependable platform promoting world class 
music events. Engineered with flexibility in mind, Retribal can support, organize, and amplify the largest and 
most complex events with many performers, venues, sponsors, and stages. This plugin is written from the ground 
up by the team at alpine.io to drive audience engagement and ticket sales.

Music Festival Search Engine Optimization

Improve your site's SEO with fully embedded performer and venue details.

The Retribal Music Festival plugin goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization. It first 
and foremost helps you build and manage a better, deeper, and more engaging music festival website. Enter 
artist profiles and venue information just once and integrate artist youtube channels, tweets, instagrams 
in real-time.

But more importantly, the Retribal plugin provides focus pages for all venues, performers, and full genre-based 
performer archive pages. Venues are fully categorized by features such as food and drink, restrooms, and 
capacity. If the venue provides social media, Retribal will integrate it. Be aware, other integration 
alternatives such as framing just don’t give your music festival website the same juicy SEO mojo.

Perfect Music Festival App Integration

The Retribal WordPress plugin is just the start of digital promotion for your Music Festival. Upgrade to the 
Retribal App and Music Festival marketing platform to fully engage your tribe - building momentum with artist 
announcements, schedule releases, ticket sales, and premium festival packages.

Retribal is the app platform dedicated to music festivals and it works perfectly with the Performer and Venue 
data you have already entered on your WordPress based website. The retribal app offers a fully branded 
solution for your music festival featuring full airplane mode support, our “Desert Island Network” stays 
functional with no connection and sips only tiny amounts of bandwidth during the festival in the remotest 
of locales, always syncing changes upon reconnection. Other features include live shuttles, amenities, 
in-seat mech sales, extensive sponsor support, maps, stage schedules, and walking directions. Read more
